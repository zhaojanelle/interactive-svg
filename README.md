# Interactive SVG

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Export the downloaded Adobe Illustrator file (`bear.ai`) into an SVG—and clean it using [Spritebot](https://github.com/thomasjbradley/spritebot).
  · [Illustrator to SVG exporting instructions](http://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/image-formats/#svg)
  · [SVG cleaning instructions](http://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/advanced-svg/#cleaning-generated-svg)
- Embed the SVG code directly in the `index.html` file.
- Add the interactivity (transitions & animations) to the SVG in the CSS file.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
